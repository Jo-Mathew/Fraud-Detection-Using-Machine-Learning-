# Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning models. With over 6 million records and only 0.13% fraud cases, the dataset presents a significant class imbalance challenge. The goal is to build robust models that not only achieve high accuracy but also maximize recall (catching frauds) while minimizing false positives.
